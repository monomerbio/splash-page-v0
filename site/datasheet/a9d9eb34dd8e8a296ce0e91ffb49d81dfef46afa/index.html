Add quality control to your assays with Monomer's Liquid Monitor Sensors. These sensors can be used as a standalone device or they can be mounted right on top of your existing instruments. Don't wait till the end of all your experiments to find out about evaporative edge effects or clogged nozzles. Discover those failure modes right when and where they happen. Reagent dispensing has been known to vary by as much as 10% over a 1-day time period. Use our analysis tools to see trends in your own lab over time or across plates for yourself. Get peace of mind that you are drawing real biological conclusions from your data rather than interpreting liquid handling aberrations.

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Measure liquid level of individual wells or tubes.</li>
      <li>Detect presence or absence of caps, seals, or lids.</li>
      <li>Flag droplets, bubbles, and as of yet unknown anomalies using a spectral camera at the individual well level. (In development.)</li>
      <li>Measure temperature of samples in individual wells. (In development.)</li>
      <li>Cross reference with local recordings of temperature and humidity. (In development.)</li>
    </ul>

    Measuring inline ensures <em>all</em> dispenses are automatically scanned. Labware is scanned on the instrument as its tray extends. Cross reference with commanded volumes and get notified when the dispensing cassette needs to be replaced rather than relying on an arbitrary monthly calendar event. Sensors can be mounted on your existing instruments directly. This obviates needing to make space for an additional instrument or program extra robot arm movements. We support the following devices for inline verification:
    <ul>
      <li>FluidX IntelliXcap</li>
      <li>Multidrop Combi SMART (coming soon)</li>
      <li>PF400 (coming soon)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Interfaces</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>For manual operation use our browser based user interface optimized for collaboration. Try for yourself <a href="https://monomerbio.com/demo">here</a>.</li>
      <li>For automation use our gRPC interface. The API is open and publicly available <a

    <h3>Positioning above Containers for Inline Sensor Array</h3>
    <p>
      Use the adjustment screws on the top of the station to set the reference mounting distance of the sensors above
      microtiter plate wells or tubes.
